# FASHION FAMOUS
Project Title: Fashion Famous
Team members: Samira Hussein, Ramatoulaye Bah, Destiny Osemwengie

What are its technical requirements?:
This is an interactive fashion dress-up game. This requires you to run on at least Java 17 because of the Kilt graphic library. 

How should somebody run the program? Where is the main class?:
The main method is located in the class titled “TheMotherBoatrd”. 
Acknowledge any help, references, inspiration, or outside resources you used. If your game includes any art or sound assets or includes the work of others in any way, credit the creator(s) and link to the source(s).
Our group got inspiration from the newly famous Roblox game “Dress to Impress”. We have music from the song “Around the World” that plays throughout the game.

Known issues:
One known issue is that the game could glitch being that we have so many assets, in addition, you might have to triple-click some of the buttons because they are lowly sensitive.

Societal impact:
Our model is skinny, we would love to expand to all shades, shapes, and races but we were limited in the time that we have so we have a “one-size-fits HER” model. We don’t have disability-inclusive features. This is intended to be a light-hearted dress-up game, anybody could come up with their interpretation, and they are all valid, just as long as you enjoy the game.

Malicious use:
We are aware that the program may not be strongly defensively coded
